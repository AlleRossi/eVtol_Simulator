# eVtol_Simulator

1.The idea is to have a base class called Vehicle, which defines all the common characteristics among different eVTOLs. 
Then, a series of subclasses statically define the unique attributes of the aircraft developed by the five manufacturing companies.

2.Later, an eVTOL factory class was created to dynamically generate instances of the vehicles that will be tested in the simulator. 
This approach is preferable because the number of vehicles of each type is unknown and varies each time the code is executed.

3.Next, a Charger class needs to be implemented. Each charger becomes available to the first vehicle in the charging queue, so it requires attributes to track availability and remaining charging time.
A factory class for chargers is unnecessary since all chargers are identical and can be created using a simple loop.

4.Finally, a Simulator class must be created with a loop that emulates the passage of time at an accelerated rate. 
This class implements functions to record flight data, manage charging queues, and handle fault events.

Assumption: The average charging time for each vehicle includes the time spent in the queue waiting for a charger to become available, as this is considered part of the charging cycle. 
This means that overall charging times are highly dependent on the composition of the fleetâ€”slower-charging vehicles that increase the waiting time for all others.
